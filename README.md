# BrewLAN

**BrewLAN** is a mod for *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* that has been in on and
off development by a team of one for over half a decade. It adds a wide variety
of new units for all factions, as well as offering several new game modes and
features. The core design goals for the mod are simple; to add new, interesting,
and visually aesthetic units which complement those already in existence and to
maximize technical compatibility with other mods. For more information, screenshots,
and the community, visit its [ModDB page](http://www.moddb.com/mods/brewlan).
